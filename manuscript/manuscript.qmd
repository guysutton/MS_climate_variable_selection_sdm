# 1. Introduction 

Ecological models are important tools to aid the development and implementation of environmental policies and management programmes [@Addison2013; @Schuwirth2019; @Sutton2022]. These models are used for conservation planning [@Guisan2013], predicting the establishment and spread of invasive species [@Martin2020], implementing biological control programmes [@Sutton2019b; @Mukherjee2021], and forecasting species responses to environmental change [@Bocedi2014], amongst other applications. Species distribution models (SDM’s) are an example of ecological models that have become increasingly popular in recent years [@Elith2009]. SDM’s typically take the form of correlative or mechanistic models that correlate species presence/absences (or pseudo-absences) to environmental covariates to identify suitable climatic conditions for the study taxon [@Elith2011]. The Maximum Entropy species distribution model (hereafter ‘MaxEnt’) is amongst the most popular methods for climate modelling studies and has been shown to perform well compared to alternative modelling algorithms [@Wisz2008; @Phillips2017]. It uses maximum entropy to distinguish between environmental conditions where the focal taxon is present from environmental conditions at sites without confirmed presence records for the taxon [@Elith2011].

In recent years, a number of studies have investigated and demonstrated that computational choices made during the model building process can have a significant influence on resulting model outputs and inferences drawn [@Warren2011; @Webber2011; @Shcheglovitova2013; @Boria2017; @Sutton2022]. Despite its importance in the model building process, covariate selection methods have received considerably little attention to date [but see @Austin2011; @Fourcade2018; @Adde2023], whereby covariate selection refers to "identify[ing] the best subset of covariates out of a panel of many candidates, both from an ecological and statistical perspective [see @Adde2023 and references therein]. 

**Next paragraphs** 

- Review current methods used to select variables, e.g. R2, VIF, PCA, expert opinion, and most recently, automated selection / model-based selection. 

- Aims of this paper are to show how variable selection can influence model outputs and inferences.
